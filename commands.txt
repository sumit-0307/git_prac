git init - invite a git to look at ur code and initialize it in an empty repo 
            or reinitialize it in an existing repo

git add - git add adds the changes made to ur project in a staging area as in a waiting room
            changes hang out in waiting room until u want to final commit 
(git add . - to add all changes
git add (file_name): git add index.html)

git commit - to save all the changes
(git commit -m "Message": git commit -m "index.html changes")

git status - if u want to see whats added in ur staging area 
            or what state ur in rn (if u r in a detachedHEAD state)

echo "# git_prac" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main   (changes ur branch from Master to main)
                    used just for naming convention 

git remote add origin https://github.com/sumit-0307/git_prac.git (provide ur git repo link to 
                                                                connect ur local git to github)

git push -u origin main     (final command to push ur code from local connection to github)


=======How to retrieve or go back to older versions of ur file=========
git log - this command provides u the list of commits and changes to ur project
(git log --oneline) : this gives u the samelog but in a shorter one line format

git checkout "HASH VALUE ID" - this lets you checkout the history of commits of a specific hash id commit
this also enters a detached HEAD state:
which means it only lets you explore the previous commits but you cant make any new commits

now if u want to get out of this detached head state just enter
git checkout main

now to GET BACK UR FILE OR GO TO BACK TO CHANGE U made
git revert "HASH ID"
